### Hello ðŸ‘‹
I am a computer science student and technology lover. I like to use and study Linux operating systems and my favorite language is Shell (POSIX) and C. I love minimalism and simplicity! (Keep it simple stupid) ðŸ˜„

### What I'm doing lately.
Developing an Environmental Conflict Observatory in the region where I live.
